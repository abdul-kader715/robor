                        <p class="fs-20 title-font mb-70">At SGW, we’ve been involved in several exciting projects that have enabled us to apply insights you gained from diverse industries to the development of solar modules. Our team has successfully undertaken the design and development of various solar-powered products, ranging from small-scale, solar-powered electronics to larger infrastructure and industrial solutions. These projects have us plenty of interesting engineering challenges.</p>

                        <p class="fs-20 title-font mb-50">Solar panels alone often prove inadequate to power a product or system effectively. To address this, we incorporate onboard batteries to provide supplementary power. However, the temperature can influence battery performance, workshop provides particularly charging and discharging.</p>

                        <p class="fs-20 title-font mb-65">As a result, it is sometimes necessary to develop temperature control provisions within the product design to ensure optimal battery performance. Additionally, during the engineering and manufactu- ring stages, we also consider serviceability and the ability to repair the product.</p>

                            <p>unlike typical indoor products, solar projects are designed for outdoor use and must be rugged enough to withstand day-to-day wear and tear, and also need to endure storms, rain, and prolonged exposure to UV radiation — all without compromising functionality. Solar panels alone often prove inadequate to power a product or system effectively.</p>
